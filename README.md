<h1>My Flying App - Fly Away </h1>
<h2>🎯 Purpose: </h2>

<b><em>'I am a client and I want to have an application to visualize planes' program and reserve tickets or see statistics about the state of 24 January this year...'</em></b>
<br>
<p>The project aims to create an GUI application which helps travelers to visualize available flights, search for specific ones and buy tickets while seeing in real time the countdown for the plane seats.</p>

<h2>👩🏻‍💻 Technology Used:</h2>
<p>I worked in java and javafx communicating with the DB</p>
<h2>📋 The structure of the project:</h2>
<p>The client's path through the application:
<ul>
<li>Log-in window - the user must enter its username to be able to enter the app</li>
<li>The account window- the actual window where everything takes place</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>🪛 Functionalities:</h2>
 <h3>🔵 Search flights</h2>
 <p>By: 'From', 'To' and 'Date' fields</p>
 <p>The user has the possibility to clear the filters if they want to see the whole catalog. </p>
   <h3>🔵 Buy tickets</h2>
 <p>After selecting a flight the client can buy one. The number of available seats is known and when a flight is sold out the row of the table become red and the client cannot purchase tickets anymore for that destination </p>
 
  <h3>🔵 See Statistics and see 'your tickets'</h2>
 <p>See how many people bought tickets on a holiday. See separately your purchases</p>
